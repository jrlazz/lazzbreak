lazzbreak is a funny form ("fufo").

Right clicking the lazzbreak block ... opens the puzzle fufo.

Sam am his world do not make part of the fun, but withot them, there were no funny forms.

So I guess lazzbreak can´t be called a mod.

The fufo is a pastime, mybe like solitaire, freecell, etc. and may or not be a game.
